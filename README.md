# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting the onset of diabetes using two different machine learning techniques:
1. **Logistic Regression** - A classification model suitable for binary outcomes.
2. **Linear Regression (with threshold)** - A regression approach with a manually set threshold to classify predictions.

## 📊 Problem Statement

The goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. This is a binary classification problem.

## 📁 Dataset

We use the [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which includes the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

**Target:** `Outcome` (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)
